Hello fellow BCC interns and aspiring data scientists! ðŸ‘‹

This BCC Data Science Department repository is your friendly guide to mastering the fundamentals of Python with a focus on skills that are essential for data science. Here, you'll learn basic programming concepts such as data types, loops, conditionals, functions, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), etc to build a solid foundation for your data science journey.

## What You'll Learn

- **Python Basics:**  
  Get started with variables, data types, operators, and expressions.

- **Control Flow:**  
  Understand loops (`for`, `while`) and conditionals (`if`, `elif`, `else`).

- **Functions:**  
  Learn how to create and use functions to write reusable code.

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  Dive into classes, objects, methods, inheritance, and more.

- **Practical Examples:**  
  Apply these concepts with examples and exercises that prepare you for more advanced topics in data science.

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/diyangraditya/BCC-python-for-DS.git
    ```

3. **Explore the Examples:**
